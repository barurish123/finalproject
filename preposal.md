# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
For my final project I was thinking of either making a guitar tuner for Iphone, a poker game that is rigged to make the dealer win or a visual novel based off of a comic book.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
At the present moment I have no plans to collaborate with any classmates but if you have any in mind that you are willing to link me up with that could be interesting.

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Do you have any recommendations on how to make the guitar tuner work or to make different cards work.
