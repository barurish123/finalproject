# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I might just call it game of poker or something along those lines


TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
I plan to make a game of poker that makes it so the dealer wins every hand. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I will see if I can make it multiplayer but I am not 100% sure how to do that right now, I will make it so that the cards get shuffled before every round and so that it works with every type of card and hand. I will also make it so that the player can enter whatever starting amount that they please. 

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will if anything just try to make a good game of poker if I can't end up figuring out the rest of it, or I will have learned something new about coding that I would not have known before. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I think I can at least make the cards shuffle and have it display the cards that the dealer puts down. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope I can make the whole game work overall by the end but I am not 100% sure if I will be able to make that work. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I am gonna do a little bit more research on how to make a game of poker and how I can make it work for different suits and numbers. I will also look into ways that I can code it in the event there is a better way outside of python.
